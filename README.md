# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Course

First lesson - [Link](https://youtu.be/MjvFeOx0Qyo)

The lesson is for those who haven't much experience in programming. There I explain what is the idea of programming and how we can use it.

There are also practice part, where students can practically see the usefulness of variables and loops and how they fasten lots of processes.

I was planning to upload the lesson to LMS system and attach to it handful files and tasks, but couldnâ€™t do it yet.
